# Loan Prediction System using Machine Learning & FastAPI

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts whether a loan should be approved based on applicant details.

It includes the full ML pipeline — data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment using FastAPI to serve real-time predictions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning models can be transformed from notebook experiments into usable backend services.
